# Entry 1

At this point, I have finalized what I want to focus on for the Freedom Project. For the Freedom Project, I want to discuss the history of Virtual Reality, How it has improved over the years, and how it could useful in the future. I wish to accomplish this by doing research and looking back at the first designs of Virtual Reality. With that information, I would then be able to determine what advancements in technology lead to the creation of modern day VR headsets like the Playstation VR and Oculus Rift.

So far, the research that I was able to discover includes the early examples of Virtual Reality and when they were created giving a good idea about how impactful it was. By also knowing when the device was made, it creates the concept of what technology was used to help make 
the innovation. At the current moment, I have two sources and those are https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/16/morton-heiligs-sensorama-simulator/ and https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/history.html.
