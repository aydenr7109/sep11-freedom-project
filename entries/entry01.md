# Entry 1

At this point, I have finalized what I want to focus on for the Freedom Project. For the Freedom Project, I want to discuss the history of Virtual Reality, How it has improved over the years, and how it could be useful in the future. I wish to accomplish this by doing research and looking back at the first designs of Virtual Reality. With that information, I would then be able to determine what advancements in technology lead to the creation of modern day VR headsets like the Playstation VR and Oculus Rift.

So far, the research that I was able to discover includes the early examples of Virtual Reality and when they were created giving a good idea about how impactful it was. By also knowing when the device was made, it creates the concept of what technology was used to help make 
the innovation. At the current moment, I have two sources and those are https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/16/morton-heiligs-sensorama-simulator/ and https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/history.html.

I am also thinking of ways as to how Virtual Reality can be useful in the future to everyone around the world. Could Virtual Reality be used as a way to communicate with others for school and certain jobs? Time will be the only way to tell but I feel that it is interesting to think of the positive impacts that could come by being able to converse with one another with a VR headset.

However, I am nervous about the issues that I might come across while working on my project. Due to the two AP classes I'm in this year which are AP Physics and AP U.S. History, I'm afraid I might be overworked and unable to find and record excellent data. Even though I have all of this potential work, I am still interested in how Virtual Reality has improved ever since the first versions due to technology and how Virtual Reality could improve the future with how VR could be used in multiple scenarios.

In the end, I'm still excited about the possibilities for what I can discover and how I can be able to use the information I find to make a website that is compelling and intriguing.
